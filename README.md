# MCNPtools
This repo contains python modules and scripts that help managing MCNP simulations and outputs. 

## read MCTAL
To easily plot MCNP data the script **scripts >  TallyRead.py** reads MCTAL files, and generates the directory **mOut** containing a file for each implemented MCNP tally. These files are called by their tally name and contain the results separated in 6 columns:

1.  cell number
2.  segment number
3.  cosine value
4.  energy value
5.  tally output
6.  tally error

These files are easily imported with numpy into a python script and subsequently plotted with matplotlib or other plotting libraries.

### Use

The script generates the output directory in the same directory of the MCTAL file, to execute the script type:

```
./TallyRead.py ~/PATH/TO/MCTAL
```

**NOTE**: it is necessary to define the path of the input starting from the home (*~*) directory.

### Jupyter

To install jupyter notebook please refer to the [installation guide](https://jupyter.org/install). 

The Jupyter notebook example is in **example > JupyterNotebook**, in that directory there is an MCNP input file **mcnp.inp** and the MCTAL output file **mcnp.inpm**. This latter file was read by **./TallyRead.py** into the **example > JupyterNotebook > mOut > f2** file which can be easily used to plot data through the notebook. for more detail open the [notebook](example/JupyterNotebook/Plot%20Tally.ipynb).

## examples
* WriteTally.py -> An example script that uses Gen.Tally module to write a surface current tally
* WriteSDEF.py  -> An example script that uses Gen.SDEF modulte to write an MCNP SDEF source
* readMCTAL.sh  -> Bash script that uses the python module [mc-tools](https://github.com/kbat/mc-tools) to extract tally data into separate files.

## Requirements

* Python versione > 3.0
* numpy
* matplotlib
* [mc-tools](https://github.com/kbat/mc-tools)
